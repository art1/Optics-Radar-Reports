# Optics-Radar-Reports

This Repository contains reports for assignments in the course Optics & Radar based observations at the Lulea University of Technology.
The master branch contains the template, the assignments are addressed in separate branches, named after the appropriate assignment/problem. Problem 2 has two parts: optics and radar, with two separate reports.
