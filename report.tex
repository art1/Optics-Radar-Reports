\section{b}

\subsection{Task 2}

\subsection{Task 4}
Power of SUm is like summing the power of each

\subsection{Task 5}
noise, and bad for radar

b) straddle loss -> signficant reduction of SNR

basically consequence of bad sampling

\subsection{Task 8}
bad because frequency resolution is bad

\subsection{Task 9}
zeropadding: adding zeroes to a rectangular function -> better resolutoin

b) read from graph with zeropadded rect function

a) lobe comparison

c)

\subsection{Task 10}
duality means reversing the thing -> transform delta is constant and vice versa

\subsection{Task 11}

vice versa

\subsection{Task 12}
only one realization of auto correlation

the more average -> the more noise cancellation; only auto correlation peak is then visible

one looses all the noise except the peak

b) 

cant get rid off DC with averaging

cross correlation features is only the triangle
-> has feature of auto correlation because it has a part of it in it (-> sum of 3 thingies)

for power spectrum:
the difference is thatif integrate

DC offset is causing the peak to be higher

can get rid of noise by averaging, but FFT in the end is better than FFT first and then add
